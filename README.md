### üèóÔ∏è Build Contracts

```bash
yarn build
```

Compiles contracts for both Foundry and Hardhat.

### üß™ Run Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

Carries out tests to verify contract functionality.

### ‚õΩ Gas Report

```bash
yarn test:gas
```

Creates detailed reports for test coverage.

### üìä Coverage Report

```bash
yarn coverage
```

Creates detailed reports for test coverage.

### üìÑ Documentation

```bash
yarn docs
```

### üñåÔ∏è Auto-fix Linting Issues

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

Automatically fixes linting problems found.

### üöÄ Generating Storage Layout

```bash
yarn check
```

To generate reports of the storage layout for potential upgrades safety using `hardhat-storage-layout`.

üîÑ Add `:forge` or `:hardhat` to any script above to target only Foundry or Hardhat environment, respectively.
